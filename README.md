Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, posing significant environmental and health concerns due to their potential toxicity. Understanding the mechanisms driving CBs is crucial for developing effective management strategies. Here, we derive a stoichiometric dynamical model that describes the population dynamics of cyanobacteria and their toxicity in north-temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our model quantifies the lethal hypoxic effects of CBs on fish mortality and evaluates the impact of cyanotoxins, specifically microcystin-LR (MC-LR), on aquatic macro-invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish species. Analyzing data from diverse north-temperate lakes with varying physical characteristics, eutrophic conditions, and water temperatures, we identify eutrophication as a pivotal catalyst in CB proliferation. Under predicted warming scenarios coupled with increased eutrophication, peak MC-LR concentrations will surge dramatically, and blooms will occur significantly earlier. Additionally, lakes with shallow epilimnions are most vulnerable. Furthermore, we uncover heterogeneous responses among fish populations in intermediate trophic levels, with severe bioaccumulation of MC-LR in higher trophic species, raising alarms over potential human health risks from consuming contaminated fish; these insights are critical for informing targeted interventions to mitigate CBs and their far-reaching ecological and health impacts. We compare our model against observations from several north-temperate lakes, demonstrating its robustness and applicability.
