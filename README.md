# Deciphering culprits for cyanobacterial blooms and lake vulnerability under future warming scenarios

Cyanobacteria (CB) are a growing threat to freshwater ecosystems due to their toxicity and environmental impact. Our stoichiometric model identifies the primary drivers of CB blooms by analyzing historical data and predicting future bloom conditions. We find that peak lake microcystin-LR will increase up to sevenfold under predicted warming conditions and blooms will happen a month earlier, with lakes with shallow epilimnions the most vulnerable. These changes will be heightened if spring temperatures rise or if additional phosphorus is input into lakes in the fall. Our model can inform stakeholders about likely culprits of CB blooms, enabling targeted management strategies and supporting policy-making for land use and recreation to mitigate CB blooms' adverse effects and ensure aquatic ecosystem health worldwide.
